🔎 Step 1: Get the "map" of your project

    Draw (on paper or Notion/Excalidraw) a high-level diagram:
    What are the main components? (editor, file explorer, preview, auth, etc.)
    How do they interact? (state flows, props, context, API calls).
    Do a dependency check: skim through package.json and note why each library is there. (E.g., why monaco-editor? why react-router-dom?)


📂 Step 2: Break the project into chunks

    Don’t try to understand everything at once. Instead:
    Pick one feature (say, the file explorer).
    Trace it end-to-end:
        Where does the state come from? (Context, Redux, useState)
        How does the UI render it? (map, conditional render, props)
        What actions modify it? (events, handlers, effects)
    Once you understand one piece well, move on to another.



🧑‍💻 Step 3: Rewrite small parts yourself

    Take a small component and rebuild it from scratch in a new file without looking at the original code.
    Compare your version vs. the original. Did you handle state/events the same way? Did the original use a pattern you didn’t know?
    This is where muscle memory replaces copy–paste memory.


🧠 Step 4: Ask "why" questions

    Every time you see something, ask:
    Why is this hook used here?
    Why pass props this way instead of context?
    Why debounce input instead of using it directly?
    Why lazy load instead of static import?
    If you can explain the “why” in plain words, you’ve understood it.



🧰 Step 5: Refactor safely

    Start refactoring one part at a time. E.g., convert a component from props-drilling → context, or extract logic into a custom hook.
    After each refactor, test that everything still works.
    This builds deeper understanding and cleaner habits.


🚫 Things not to do

    ❌ Don’t try to understand the whole project in one sitting → overwhelming.
    ❌ Don’t refactor everything at once → you’ll break stuff and get discouraged.
    ❌ Don’t just “read” the code passively → instead, trace execution with console.logs, React DevTools, breakpoints.

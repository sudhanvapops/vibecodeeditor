### Your Immediate Assignment

Do ONLY this:
    Create FileManager class
    Move editor to read/write through it
    Confirm app works without touching backend

When that works, come back and say:
    Layer 1 complete.


### Where Is The Current Source Of Truth? 

There are three copies of content:

1️⃣ templateData
Contains TemplateFile with file.content
(This originally came from DB)

2️⃣ openFiles
Each open file has:
content
originalContent
hasUnsavedChanges

3️⃣ editorContent
Separate string in state.


DB
 ↓
templateData (folder tree)
 ↓
openFiles[]
 ↓
editorContent

That is 4 layers of truth.
This is why refactoring feels overwhelming.
Because ownership is blurry.


Right now:
    templateData stores structure + content
    openFiles stores content again
    editorContent stores content again

You are duplicating file state across multiple places.
This is completely normal for a growing project. But now we clean it.


### Your Refactor Mission (Layer 1 Goal)
FileManager
   ↓
owns content

And everything else becomes a projection.

Meaning:
    Editor reads from FileManager
    openFiles becomes just UI state (which file is open)
    templateData becomes only structure (no content ownership)


### What I DID

What This Achieves

Now your architecture becomes:

Zustand → UI State Only
FileManager → Data State Only


### Step 1 — Identify What FileManager Will Own
path
content
isDirty

Not UI concerns.
Not active tab.
Not toasts.

Pure file data.


Right now:
    openFiles[].content is acting as your filesystem.
    So your first step is NOT to rewrite everything.

Your first step is to:
    Extract the file-content logic out of Zustand.




### Step B — Isolate Content Management

You are extracting only this responsibility:
    updateFileContent
    openFile
    closeFile
    editorContent
This is where content lives.
Not there UI Responibility parts 

You must now ask:
    Can I remove editorContent entirely?
Because if FileManager owns content,
editorContent becomes derived from active file.
That’s a huge simplification.

### Step C — Build Minimal FileManager

OpenFile = UI TAB
TemplateFile = DISK FILE
FileManager = CONTENT OWNER

STEP 1 — Create FileManager
STEP 2 — Modify Zustand Types
STEP 3 — Fix openFile
STEP 4 — Replace updateFileContent
STEP 5 — Fix closeFile
STEP 6 — closeAllFiles
STEP 7 — DELETE editorContent


inside editor component
STEP 8 — Editor Reads From FileManager

How does React know FileManager changed?
Core Principle

Your situation is identical to:
    React + external database
    React + WebSocket store
    React + filesystem watcher
    React + CRDT engine

React cannot react to plain class mutations.
So you must expose subscriptions.

FileManager (external store)



useSyncExternalStore()
External stores outside React/Zustand/Redux.
Exactly your FileManager.


What You Currently Have

Right now your Zustand store is handling:
   📦 Template tree mutation (add/delete/rename)
   💾 Persistence (saveTemplateData)
   🖥 Runtime sync (writeFileSync, instance.makeFolder)
   🧠 UI state (open files, active file)
   🔔 Toast notifications
That’s 5 responsibilities in one place.

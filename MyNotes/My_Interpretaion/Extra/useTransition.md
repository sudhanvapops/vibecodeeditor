### useTransition() hook

- when you have a lot of data incoming or process is going
- it will take a while to display ui

- since react uses batch to update
- so many things will get at once including user input


<!-- ! It wll help to get priority  -->

- defualt all have high priority
- so wrap it up to make it low priority

You’re building an AI suggestion system in the Monaco Editor — like how GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT inline suggestions work.

When the user presses Tab or Enter to accept a suggestion, several things happen almost at the same time:

The key press event fires.

Monaco calls your inline completion provider.

The editor updates the cursor position.

You insert text programmatically using executeEdits.

If these happen too fast or twice (e.g., user double-taps Tab), you could insert the same suggestion twice — or even crash Monaco’s internal state.

That’s what we call a race condition — multiple events racing to update the same thing.

### connectToWebContainer

This function:
Checks if WebContainer is available
Marks the UI as “Connected”
Prints connection status to the terminal
Shows a new prompt

It does NOT actually open a network connection — WebContainer runs locally in the browser.
Instead, this function acts like a handshake and improves UX.

### WEBContainer Preview

Purpose

WebContainerPreview is the orchestrator.
It builds your entire online development environment by:
Transforming template → WebContainer file format
Mounting project files into WebContainer
Installing npm dependencies
Starting dev server inside WebContainer
Showing output in terminal
Showing the running app in an iframe

In very simple words:
This component is the “setup pipeline” that turns a template into a full running dev environment inside the browser.

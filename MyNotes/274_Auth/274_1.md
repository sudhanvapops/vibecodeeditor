In this video we define entire 
Prima schema for our authenticaition

Basis on Prisma schema we Implement our
Authentication Logic

### Middle Ware 

auth is a wrapper for middleware provided by auth.js

export default auth((req) => {
  // middleware logic here
})

Auth.js runs first:
    Checks cookies.
    Validates session/JWT.
    Adds req.auth = { user, expires, ... } if logged in.
    Or req.auth = null if not logged in.
    Then your code runs with an enriched req.

and injects the result into req.auth

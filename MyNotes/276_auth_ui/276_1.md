## Replica set For Mongo DB compass for access denied error
for transaction

1. MongoDB's Architecture Limitation
MongoDB only supports ACID transactions on replica sets, not on standalone instances. This is a fundamental limitation of MongoDB itself, not just Prisma

3. Why Transactions Matter
Without transactions, you could end up with:

✅ User created successfully
❌ Account creation fails
💥 Result: User exists but has no linked account (broken data)

Standalone MongoDB: ❌ No transactions
MongoDB Replica Set: ✅ Supports transactions
MongoDB Atlas: ✅ Always uses replica sets

### Fix 

- For now i chose mongo db atlas

### db.ts

Notes:

PrismaClient → Auto-generated client (after prisma generate).
globalThis → Global object in Node.js (like window in browser).

Why use globalThis?

Next.js hot reloads in dev mode.
Without this trick, every reload creates a new PrismaClient → too many DB connections.
In production → no hot reload, so one client is enough.

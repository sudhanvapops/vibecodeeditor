What can you do with a full web development environment like @webcontainer/api?

With it, you can:

✔ Write and edit code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, etc.)
✔ Run server-side code (like Node.js apps) directly in the browser
✔ Install npm packages and use libraries
✔ Test and debug code instantly
✔ Share a live environment with others (like a sandbox)
✔ Learn or teach coding without installing anything
✔ Run scripts, commands, and interact with a terminal

callback

NextAuth has specific events (like login, session creation, redirect).
You can pass your own function to run when that event happens.
signIn here is a callback function.
NextAuth will call it automatically whenever a login attempt happens.
You don’t call it yourself — you just define it


<!-- ! the provider db gives the call back function the required data -->

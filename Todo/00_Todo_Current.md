### For Now I will start implimenting Open Github Repo

Provide link
clone the repo
dump the project into db

1. First Make Frontend 
2. Then Backend 

### How to Do that
Direct ZIP download
https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/archive/refs/heads/{branch}.zip
Extract the owner repo and brach from provided Url

make the request and do it

Frontend → sends repo URL → Backend → downloads repo → extracts → loads files → Store in Db → sends to frontend/editor

### Future: Make it also for Private REPO
